# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

My motivation to start this project was passion for technology and a need of change in my carreer. It's been too long since I tried doing something different and this guide was one of the very first steps to a big change in my life.
This guide will help me organize myself through notes during the bootcamp and will ensure the information I need will always be easy to find. I've learned how to do the basics on a few languages so far, but most importantly, I've learned it's never too late to learn something new, and you CAN teach an old dog new tricks.

## Usage

Each section contains separate notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript . They will be updated as the bootcamp progresses. If you open the DevTools console you will see the script running with a list of topics we learned so far. Every time you refresh the page it will pick a different topic to be studied first !

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
